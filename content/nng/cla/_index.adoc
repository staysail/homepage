== Staysail Systems, Inc. CLAs

Thank you for your contribution!

In order to contribute code to our repositories, we require all contributors to sign
a Contributor License Agreement (CLA).

TIP: We require these CLAs to ensure that we can relicense your contributions in
our commercial products, so that all users of this code base can benefit.

There are two forms of this agreement, one for individual contributors, and one
for corporate entities. There should be copies located in the repository to which you
are contributing.

To submit this approval, please print, sign, and scan the agreement, then email
it to info@staysail.tech.

We will then counter-sign it and return it to you.

TIP: The counter-signature is important, because the agreement is bi-lateral.
We are promising to release your changes under the same open source license
as the repository to which you are contributing.

Once this is approved, we will note that in your Pull Request, or otherwise
where appropriate.
