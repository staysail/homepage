== Errata

This page lists errata for books that we have published.

=== _NNG Reference Manual_ (First Edition, May 2018)

Only issues found with the *books* are reported here. 
The NNG manual pages located on the NNG are tracked and updated
using the https://github.com/nanomsg/nng/issues[NNG GitHub Issues]
page.

1. The description for `nng_recv()` fails to mention that
   `NNG_FLAG_NONBLOCK` may be used for non-blocking operation.
   The description  of `nng_recvmsg()` does describe this flag, and
   the description located there can be used in the meantime.
