=== _NNG Reference Manual_ (First Edition, May 2018 and June 2018)

Only issues found with the *books* are reported here. 
The NNG manual pages located on the NNG are tracked and updated
using the https://github.com/nanomsg/nng/issues[NNG GitHub Issues]
page.

****
There are two versions of the first edition.  The May 2018 printed
edition is printed by Ingram Spark on cream paper, and uses full
justification throughout.  The June 2018 printed edition is printed by
Amazon, and uses left justified text on white paper.  The only other
changes are some extremely minor changes to the front matter, and
repagination to cope with larger margin requirements at Amazon.
Consequently, the June 2018 edition is 430 pages instead of 424.

The eBooks likewise have both May and June editions, with the only
differences being a switch to left justification of the text and
minor adjustments to the front matter.

No interior content (wording) was changed between the May and June 2018
versions.  Consequently, the ISBNs were not changed.

1. The description for `nng_recv()` fails to mention that
   `NNG_FLAG_NONBLOCK` may be used for non-blocking operation.
   The description  of `nng_recvmsg()` does describe this flag, and
   the description located there can be used in the meantime.

2. (Only in the May 2018 paperback printed edition.)  The frontmatter indicates
   that the book is printed in the United States.  We have changed the
   distribution network we use to gain global reach, and it's likely
   that if you buy the book somewhere *other* than United States, that
   book will have been printed somewhere closer to you.  This is both
   more economical, and more environnmentally friendly, as we don't need to
   ship dead trees around the world.  (For instance
   at this time, most copies sold in Europe are actually printed in the
   UK.)

3. If you got the May 2018 Kindle download from Amazon, there are numerous
   formatting errors caused by Ingram's poor conversion of ePub to MOBI.
   The June 2018 version corrects those errors.  It also has a lower list
   price of $9.99.

4. The Kindle editions from Amazon seem to have lost the visual icons
   for "TIP", "NOTE", and "IMPORTANT" indicators.  This is a limitation on
   some Kindle readers.  We will use images instead for the next edition.
