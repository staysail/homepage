== _Written by Garrett D'Amore_

This manual is the authoritative and official reference for the NNG
project, encompassing the entire set of manual pages produced for
the project.
 
== Availability

While the content is available as part of the NNG project, you can
also purchase a paperback desk edition, or electronic book formats
compatible with all popular e-readers.

If you plan to buy an eBook version, please consider purchasing from 
http://leanpub.com/nngmanual[Leanpub].
You can choose your own price less this way, and Leanpub takes significantly
less from authors than other venues.

By the way, the electronic versions of this book are also available
for *free* from Leanpub.  If you've already purchased any version of the book,
you are encouraged to make use of these free downloads.

Otherwise, we do suggest you consider purchasing a copy in the
format of your choosing.  Purchases of this book help defray the costs
incurred in producing it and keeping it updated, and also help fund
further development of NNG itself.
