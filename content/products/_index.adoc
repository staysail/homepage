Staysail Systems, Inc. offers the following products:

* wolfSSL plugin support for https://github.com/nanomsg/nng[NNG].

A free version is available on GitHub under GPLv3.0, but we also
provide a commercially licensed version.  This enables commercial
applications and FIPS 140-2 validated solutions, and TLS 1.3 to
be created with NNG.

* matrixSSL plugin support for https://github.com/nanomsg/nng[NNG].

(Forthcoming.) This plugin will provide support for solutions
using matrix SSL with NNG.  As with the wolfSSL plugin, this should
enable the possiblity of creating FIPS 140-2 validated solutions.

* Other TLS or SSL plugins for NNG.
