Staysail Systems develops software for distributed and embedded systems,
ranging from IoT embedded devices to large scale enterprise systems.

We are experts in scalable and performant communications.

Staysail is also a contributor to the open source ecosystem; we develop
in C and Go, and our founders have produced some of the more widely
used systems that power the Internet today.
