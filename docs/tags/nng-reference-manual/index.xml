      <description>Written by Garrett D&amp;#8217;Amore This manual is the authoritative and official reference for the NNG project, encompassing the entire set of manual pages produced for the project.
   Availability While the content is available as part of the NNG project, you can also purchase a paperback desk edition, or electronic book formats compatible with all popular e-readers.
 Purchases of this book help defray the costs incurred in producing it and keeping it updated, and also help fund further development of NNG itself.</description>
